# Brain-Tumor-Detector

Abnormal cell growths in the cells of the brain causes the brain tumor. 
The tumor should be detected at an initial stage to save the life of the patient. Nowadays segmentation of the brain MRI is an essential task in the medical field. 
This project defines different ways in which this can be done and provides a MATLAB code for that. 
Segmentation is basically the process of extracting or grouping of pixels in an image based on intensity. It can be achieved in different ways like thresholding, region growing, contours and water sheds. 
In this project we have segmented the tumor part and then classified the tumor into benign tumor or malignant tumor using support vector machine.

Image Segmentation: The purpose of image segmentation is to partition an image into meaningful regions with respect to a particular application.
The segmentation might be grey level, colour, texture, depth or motion.
